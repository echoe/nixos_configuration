Default nixos install for dev. Featuring:

-Pantheon Display Manager, because it's pretty.

-Flatpaks for anything that I think might get broken or otherwise be a pain in the ass when installed into the default nixos setup.

-The default set of packages I want to use.

-An optional configuration file specifying a musnix setup for low latency audio. For this to work, musnix needs to be cloned to /home/iris/Documents/Git/musnix . If you have cloned it elsewhere, change this reference in the configuration before running.
