My default NixOS settings. Featuring:

-Pantheon Display Manager, because it's pretty.

-A default set of packages: Vim, git, and Firefox.

-Flatpaks for anything that I think might get broken or otherwise be a pain in the ass when installed into the default nixos setup: VSCode, Steam, Bitwig Studio, and OBS Studio with the Droidcam extension.

Todo: Real time audio, as per https://github.com/musnix/musnix.
