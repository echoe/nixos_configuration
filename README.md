Default nixos install for dev. Featuring:

-Gnome display manager, because it's basic and Enlightenment breaks on 1366x768 screens.

-Flatpaks for anything that I think might get broken or otherwise be a pain in the ass when installed into the default nixos setup.

-The default set of packages I want to use.

-steam-devices udev rules.

-The latest low latency kernel, for music production.
